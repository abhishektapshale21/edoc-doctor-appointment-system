## 🛠️ Getting Started

### 1. Run with One Command (Root)
```bash
npm run dev
```
This runs both the Express backend and React Vite client concurrently:
- **Frontend App:** [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- **Backend API:** [http://localhost:5001](http://localhost:5001)

### 2. Database Modes
The system includes an intelligent dual-mode database layer:
- **Zero-Config Embedded Mode (Default):** Runs immediately without requiring external database services. Persists data to `server/data/store.json`.
- **MongoDB / Atlas Mode:** Open `server/.env` and set:
  ```env
  MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/edoc
  # or MongoDB Atlas URI:
  # MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@cluster.mongodb.net/edoc
  ```
  The server will automatically connect to MongoDB, setup Mongoose models, and populate initial seeds.
